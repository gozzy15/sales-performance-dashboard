# Sales Performance Dashboard

This project is a Sales Performance Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel 2016.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed Superstore sales data to uncover insights into revenue, profitability, customer segments, and regional performance. Using advanced Excel (including Pivot Tables, dashboards, and automated macros), I built an interactive sales dashboard that highlights:  
📈 Top-performing regions, categories, and markets driving revenue growth  
💰 Profitability trends across customer segments and product categories  
🚚 Shipping cost vs. profit trade-offs to optimize logistics  
🔍 Discount and sales impact analysis to identify margin leakages  
🕒 Yearly and weekly sales trends for better forecasting  
This solution enables business leaders to track KPIs in real time, identify underperforming areas, and make data-driven decisions that improve sales efficiency and profitability.
